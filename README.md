# Music-Player
Music Player for a Passive Piezzo Buzzer able to play multiple sounds at once.

The buzzers are controlled by a square wave generated by the microcontroller.
The function toggle sound is checks if enough time has passed to switch the bit.
Because frequency and octaves have a exponential/logarithmic relationship, the scale of available
frequency is adjustable by using the prescaler of a microcontroller. This code was specifically
implemented for a PIC10F200.
